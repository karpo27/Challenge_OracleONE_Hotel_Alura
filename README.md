# Challenge OracleONE: Hotel Alura
![Badge en Desarollo](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20DEVELOPEMENT-green)

This project is part of the training program of One Next Education Alura Latam and consists of creating two hotels apps belonging to the Alura Group. A stored procedure was created that automatically releases rooms when the application starts by comparing the system date with the end dates of the reservations. A trigger was also created that automatically generates the invoice at the time of inserting a reservation, calculating the costs according to the room type and the days between dates. Finally, a trigger was created that recalculates the costs when updating a reservation. A script named ScriptHotels.sql is included that contains everything necessary to create the database.
